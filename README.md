# Asteroids Game

**Author:** Fran Molina

## Description

This project is a clone of the classic Asteroids game, developed as a practical exercise for the Boot.dev course. The game is implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Features

- Spaceship control with rotation and movement
- Shooting system with cooldown
- Asteroids that split into smaller fragments when destroyed
- Collision detection
- Logging system for game events

## How to Play

### Controls

- **A/D**: Rotate the ship
- **W/S**: Move forward/backward
- **Spacebar**: Shoot

### Running the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending the Project

Here are some ideas to expand and improve the project:

- **Scoring system**: Add a score counter for destroyed asteroids
- **Multiple lives and respawning**: Implement a lives system and player respawn
- **Explosion effect**: Add animations when asteroids are destroyed
- **Player acceleration**: Make movement more realistic with gradual acceleration
- **Screen wrapping**: Make objects reappear on the opposite side when leaving the screen
- **Background image**: Add a space background with stars
- **Different weapon types**: Implement multiple shot types and weapon power-ups
- **Lumpy asteroids**: Create asteroids with more realistic shapes instead of perfect circles
- **Triangular hitbox**: Change the ship's hitbox from circular to triangular for better precision
- **Shield power-up**: Add temporary shields that protect the ship
- **Speed power-up**: Implement power-ups that temporarily increase speed
- **Bombs**: Add bombs that can be dropped to destroy multiple asteroids
